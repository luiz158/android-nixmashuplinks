##About NixMashup Links##

NixMashup Links begin as a collection of links published periodically at [NixMash.com.](http://nixmash.com/nixmashup)

They are then processed and converted into individual objects at [NixMashupLinks.com](http://nixmashuplinks.com)

As individual data objects with tagging and searchable engine the links are now available to serve devices like Android. The Server API is not currently available but sample XML and Urls are included in the /docs folder.

###Sample XML###

Sample data format is found in _docs/sample-data.xml_

###Sample Urls###

Urls used include retrieving ALL links, links by TAG and SEARCH. Url structures are found in _docs/sample-urls.txt_
